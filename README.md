# Kolakoski
Various c++ algorithms for computation with the Kolakoski sequence.

Includes some joint work with Yongyi Chen and Michael Yan from Spring 2015.

See the following papers, which discuss the Kolakoski sequence and various related algorithms. Admittedly, the code is still lacking in documentation.

The procedues are largely just straightforward recursion, but there are a few tricky elements. These are cycle decomposition of a permutation, constructing Eulerian cycles from 2-regular graphs, and FFT multiplication.
